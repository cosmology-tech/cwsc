# `cwsc`: CWScript Compiler

CWScript is a high-level programming language designed for writing smart contracts on the CosmWasm platform. It is focused on simplifying the process of creating smart contracts while maintaining compatibility with Rust and CosmWasm programming patterns. CWScript enforces a more constrained framework for writing smart contracts, allowing developers to build on a well-defined domain. This approach aims to streamline code organization, composability patterns, and the overall development experience.

cwsc is written in TypeScript and requires Node.js v16 or later.

Please refer to the official documentation for a complete guide on how to use CWScript and the cwsc compiler. Discover how to create, compile, and deploy smart contracts, and learn about the unique features of CWScript that simplify development and increase productivity.

## Examples

### Hello World

```rs
contract HelloWorld {
    state {
        greeting: String
    }

    #instantiate(init_greeting: String) {
        $state.greeting = init_greeting
    }

    exec #update_greeting(new_greeting: String) {
        $state.greeting = new_greeting
    }

    query #get_greeting() -> String {
        return $state.greeting
    }
}
```

### Simple Token Contract

```rs
contract MyToken {
    state {
        total_supply: Uint128,
        balances[Address]: Uint128 = 0
    }

    #instantiate(initial_supply: Uint128) {
        let creator = $info.sender
        $state.total_supply = initial_supply
        $state.balances[creator] = initial_supply
    }

    exec #transfer(to: Address, amount: Uint128) {
        let sender = $info.sender
        let sender_balance = $state.balances[sender] ?? Uint128(0)

        assert!(sender_balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance")

        $state.balances[sender] = sender_balance - amount
        $state.balances[to] += amount
    }

    query #balance_of(address: Address) -> Uint128 {
        return $state.balances[address] ?? Uint128(0)
    }

    query #total_supply() -> Uint128 {
        return $state.total_supply
    }
}
```

### Proxy Contract

```rs
import { CW20 } from "standards/cw20"

contract ProxyContract {
    state {
        target_token: Address
    }

    #instantiate(target_token_address: Address) {
        $state.target_token = target_token_address
    }

    exec #transfer_proxy(to: Address, amount: Uint128) {
        let sender = $info.sender

        // Call the transfer method of the target CW20 contract
        exec! CW20($state.target_token).#transfer(to, amount)
    }

    query #balance_of_proxy(address: Address) -> Uint128 {
        // Call the balance_of method of the target CW20 contract
        return query! CW20($state.target_token).#balance_of(address)
    }
}
```

### AtomicOrderExample (Injective Protocol)

```rs
import { SubaccountId, MarketId } from "injective/types"
import { FPDecimal } from "injective/math"
import { CW2 } from "standards/cw2"

const CONTRACT_NAME = "crates.io:atomic-order-example"

      base_denom: String,
      quote_denom: String
    }
    swap_operation_state: struct SwapCacheState {
      sender_address: String,
      deposited_amount: Coin
    }
  }

  #instantiate(

      owner: $info.sender,
      contract_subaccount_id: SubaccountId($env.contract.address, 0),
    }

    CW2.set_contract_version!($, CONTRACT_NAME, CONTRACT_VERSION)

    // we've changed it to "config"
    $state.config = config
    emit event(method="instantiate", owner=$info.sender) // anonymous event

    let quantity = FPDecimal!(trade_data.quantity)
    let price = FPDecimal!(trade_data.price)
    let fee = FPDecimal!(trade_data.fee)

    let { config, cache } = $state
    let contract_address = $env.contract.address
    let subaccount_id = config.contract_subaccount_id
    let cache = $state.cache

  }

    let { config } = $state
    let contract = $env.contract.address

    let min_deposit = price quantity

    if $info.funds.is_empty() {

    }

    let message_deposit = FPDecimal!($info.funds[0].amount)

    }

    let order = SpotOrder(
      price, quantity, OrderType.#BuyAtomic, config.market_id, subaccount_id, contract
    )

    let coins = $info.funds[0]
